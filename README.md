# Graduate Admission Prediction with Linear Regression

This repository explores the factors influencing graduate admission chances using a linear regression model. By analyzing the Admission_Predict dataset, I've developed a model that achieves [your R-squared] accuracy in predicting admission outcomes. The analysis reveals [mention 1-2 key insights, e.g., the strong influence of CGPA and GRE scores].  Explore the relationship between academic credentials and admission outcomes.

**Key Features:**

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Linear regression model training and evaluation
* Feature importance analysis


**Dataset:**

The `Admission_Predict.csv` dataset contains information on various factors, including GRE scores, TOEFL scores, CGPA, Statement of Purpose (SOP) strength, Letter of Recommendation (LOR) strength, University Rating, Research experience, and the Chance of Admit for prospective graduate students.  The goal is to predict the "Chance of Admit" based on the other features.


**Dependencies:**

* Python >= 3.6
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn (optional, for enhanced visualizations)

Install dependencies using: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (create a `requirements.txt` file listing these libraries).


**Results:**

* **Model Performance:** The linear regression model achieved an R-squared score of [your R-squared value], indicating [interpretation of R-squared, e.g., that approximately X% of the variance in admission chances can be explained by the model].  The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is [your RMSE value].
* **Key Factors:** The analysis revealed that [mention key factors and their relationship to admission chances, e.g., CGPA and GRE scores were the strongest predictors, a higher university rating had a positive impact, etc.].  Refer to the visualizations in the notebook for a detailed overview.
* **Model Limitations:**  Linear regression makes certain assumptions (linearity, independence of errors, etc.).  These assumptions may not perfectly hold in real-world admissions scenarios. The model should be used as a tool to estimate probabilities, not as a definitive predictor.  Future work could explore more complex models or additional features to improve accuracy.
